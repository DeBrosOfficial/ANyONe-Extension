# ANyONe Extension - Manage Socks5 Proxy Settings

## Overview
**The ANyONe Proxy Extension** is a powerful Chromium-based browser extension designed to help users manage and switch between different proxy settings effortlessly. It offers:

- **Quick access** through the browser's toolbar.
- **Detailed control** via an options page.

Additionally, the extension features a **dApp Store**, enabling users to access decentralized applications directly from the extension. **This tool also simplifies access to the Socks5 Proxy of your official ANyONe router.** Created by DeBros, it is a community-driven project and **not an official ANyONe product**.

**Note:** It's recommended to leverage local Socks5 Proxies within our internal network for optimal security and performance. Always confirm you are within the ANyONe network by pressing the 'Check ANyONe' button.
